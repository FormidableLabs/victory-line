Victory Line
=============

`victory-line` draws an SVG pie or donut chart with [React](https://github.com/facebook/react). Styles and data can be customized by passing in your own values as properties to the component. Data changes are animated with [victory-animation](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory-animation).

## Examples

The plain component has baked-in sample data, style, and angle defaults, so even when no props are specified, an example line will be rendered:

``` playground
<VictoryLine style={{border: "2px solid black"}}/>
```
