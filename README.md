Victory Line
============

`victory-line` draws an SVG line on your screen. Unlike core `d3`, it can graph
functions or passed in data, from a clean `React` interface. Style, data,
interpolate, scale -- all can be overridden by passing in new values.

IMPORTANT
=========

This project is in a pre-release state. We're hard at work fixing bugs and improving the API. Be prepared for breaking changes!
